## Data Table

This is the set of data which includes a the miles per per gallon (mpg), number of cylinders (cyl), and weights (wt) of cars a sample of cars currently on the market. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
mtcars[,c(1, 2, 6)]
```

Mpg is measured in miles/(US)gallons and wt is in thousands.

## Summary of the Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars[, c(1, 6)])
```

Within this set we see the average mpg of cars is roughly 20.1 mpg and teh average weight is 3,217lbs.

## Effect of Weight on Mpg


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x =wt , y =mpg, color=cyl )) + geom_point()
```

Through this plot there is a clear inverse realtionship between the weight of a car and the miles per gallon the car gets. Also noteable is that cars with a higher number of cylinders tend to weigh more.

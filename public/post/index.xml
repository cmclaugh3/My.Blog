      <description>#Good Morning Vietnam
Not entirely sure what I want to write here but it was a good weekend these past few days. We spent Firday afternoon on a nice sunset cruise around the harbor and then got a nice dinner as well after. Saturday morning I was up early for a great day of surfing and then spent the night watching the soccer game.</description>
